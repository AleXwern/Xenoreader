This is a script for Xenosaga 1&2 DS
1. script_raw contains script as it is in the gamefiles. All files open nicely in any text editor but it's encoded in SHIFT-JIS so you'll need a text/hex editor that supports it.
2. script_filtered is the same script, but only the XXX_XXX.evc files and all non printable characters removed and replaced with linebreaks for nice and more readable format.
There are some junk and extra characters but the filtered should still be very clear.
